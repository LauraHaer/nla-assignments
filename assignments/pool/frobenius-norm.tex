\begin{Problem}
  The Frobenius norm of real matrix $\mata$, defined as follows:
  \begin{gather*}
    \norm{\mata}_F = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1,j=1}^{i\leq m,j\leq n} a_{i,j}^2}
  \end{gather*}
  is an extension of the Euclidean norm to $\R^{m\times n}$. It is
  sometimes useful for numerical linear algebra applications as it
  is possible to straightforwawrdly compute it. Prove the following
  statements:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item The Frobenius norm is a norm.
  \item Multiplication by an orthogonal matrix does not change the
    norm: $\norm{\matq\mata}_F = \norm{\mata}$, where
    $\matq\in\R^{m\times m}$ is a unitary real matrix.
  \item
    $\norm{\mata}_2 \leq \norm{\mata}_F \leq
    \sqrt{r}\norm{\mata}_2$, where $r$ is the rank of the real
    matrix $\mata$. \textit{Hint:} use SVD.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}
